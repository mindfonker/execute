## execute
- Install Required Libraries:
Ensure you have Python installed. If not, download and install it from Python's official [website](https://www.python.org/). Install the requests library by running pip install requests in your terminal/command prompt.

- Copy the Python Code: 
Copy the provided Python code into a Python script file (e.g., fetch_website_content.py) using a text editor or an IDE like VSCode or PyCharm.

- Replace the URL: 
Replace "https://www.example.com" with the URL of the website you want to fetch data from within the url_to_scrape variable.

- Run the Script: 
Run the Python script in your terminal or command prompt by navigating to the directory containing the script and typing python fetch_website_content.py (if your script filename is fetch_website_content.py). This will execute the script and print the fetched website content.

- Interpret the Output: 
The script will display the content of the website, or it will show an error message if something went wrong during the fetch process.

Remember, while scraping data from websites, it's essential to check the website's terms of service and ensure that you're allowed to scrape its content. Unauthorized scraping may violate website policies or legal regulations.
